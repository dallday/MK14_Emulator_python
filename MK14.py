# This is an emulator for MK14 using python
# This loads the monitor rom into Rom space 
# plus can load a hex file by specify it as the parameter

#
# The code was taken from one provided on github
#  https://github.com/robdobsn/MK14PyEm
#
#  first fix was to change start address to x000 
#   as the scmp  increments the program counter first and then get op code
#   
#  The code now multiplexes the 7 segment display like the real MK14 does

#
#  memVals  - defines the contents to write to memory
#            each entry has an address element
#                 followed by a data element 
#                       which is a number of bytes
#           Note: During intial setup (mem.init) the ROM can be written to.
